## General info
This is a discord bot (see Features for function). It is still in it's early stages and can only post the newest cumulative incidence values that are posted by the RKI. I'm currently working on more functions for the bot.

## Features

Creates a discord bot that responds to !, if a name of a german countie is typed after the "!" the bot will search trough the newest cumulative incidence values in that countie or city and post it in the channel.

## To-Do
* Save data to a JSON file and use some statistics
